Are You Sure?  - A light "dirty forms" JQuery Plugin!
======
**Version:** 1.5


*Are-you-sure* (```jquery.are-you-sure.js```) is simple light-weight "dirty 
form" JQuery Plugin for modern browsers.  It helps prevent users from losing 
unsaved HTML Form changes by promoting the user to save/submit.

It's simple to use.  Just add the following line to your page's ready 
function:

```javascript
$('form').areYouSure();
```

*Are-you-sure* is a minimal plugin for modern browsers.  There are plenty of 
"dirty forms" implementations out there, however they all seemed very 
heavyweight and over-engineered...! Most were written some time back and 
contain many 'hacks' to support legacy browsers, and/or rely on other fat 
dependencies such as FaceBox or jQueryUI.  *Are-you-sure* solves this by
doing this simple task in the simplest possible way.

*Are-you-sure* is as simple as it gets:

 * 100% JS with zero dependencies and no external CSS.
 * Leverages `onBeforeUnload` to detect all page/browser exit events.
 * Works on forms of any size.
 * Correct state management - if a user edits then restores a value, the form 
   is not considered dirty.
 * Easy to understand - less than a "terminal screen" of code!
 * Graceful degradation on legacy browsers (i.e. if you're running an old 
   browser... remember to save :-)

###Basic Usage

```javascript

$(function() {

    // Enable on all forms
    $('form').areYouSure();

    // Enable on selected forms
    $('form.dirty-check').areYouSure();

    // With a custom message
    $('form').areYouSure( {'message':'Your profile details are not saved!'} );

}
```
To ignore selected fields from the dirtyness check: 

```html
  <form id="myForm" name="myform" action="/post" method="post">

    Field 1: (checked)                  <input type="text" name="field1"> <br />
    Field 2: (ignored with attribute):  <input type="text" name="field2" data-ays-ignore="true"> <br />
    Field 3: (ignored with class):      <input type="text" name="field3" class="ays-ignore"> <br />

    <input type="submit" value="Submit">

  </form>
```

###Advanced Usage

```javascript

$(function() {

    /*
    *  Make Are-You-Sure "silent" by disabling the warning message 
    *  (tracking/monitoring only mode). This option is useful when you wish to 
    *  use the dirty/save events and/or use the dirtyness tracking in your own 
    *  beforeunload handler.
    */
    $('form').areYouSure( {'silent':true} );

    /*
    *  Dirtyness Change Events
    *  Are-You-Sure fires off "dirty" and "clean" events when the form's state
    *  changes. You can bind() or on(), these events to implement your own form
    *  state logic.  A good example is enabling/disabling a Save button.
    *
    *  "this" refers to the form that fired the event.
    */
    $('form').on('dirty.areYouSure', function() {
      // Enable save button only as the form is dirty.
      $(this).find('input[type="submit"]').removeAttr('disabled');
    });
    $('form').on('clean.areYouSure', function() {
      // Form is clean so nothing to save - disable the save button.
      $(this).find('input[type="submit"]').attr('disabled', 'disabled');
    });

    /*
    *  It's easy to test if a form is dirty in your own code - just check
    *  to see if it has a "dirty" CSS class.
    */
    if ($('#my-form').hasClass('dirty')) {
        // Do something
    }

    /*
    *  If you're dynamically adding new fields/inputs, and would like to track 
    *  their state, trigger Are-You-Sure to rescan the form like this:
    */
    $('#my-form').trigger('rescan.areYouSure');

    /*
    *  If you'd like to reset/reinitialize the form's state as clean and 
    *  start tracking again from this new point onwards, trigger the
    *  reinitalize as follows. This is handy if say you've managing your
    *  own form save/submit via asyc AJAX.
    */
    $('#my-form').trigger('reinitialize.areYouSure');
    
    /*
    *  As an alternative to using events, you can pass in a custom change 
    *  function.
    */
    $('#my-adv-form').areYouSure({
        change: function() {
                  // Enable save button only if the form is dirty. i.e. something to save.
                  if ($(this).hasClass('dirty')) {
                    $(this).find('input[type="submit"]').removeAttr('disabled');
                  } else {
                    $(this).find('input[type="submit"]').attr('disabled', 'disabled');
                  }
                }
    });
	/*
    *  You can add callback to be run before the unload call and determine if the unlooad call will be execute. 
	*  It is very useful for creating themed modals for unload event that fiured because of clicking on links.
    */
	$('#my-adv-form').areYouSure({before_unload_callback: function() {
			if(window.unload_source != 'anchor') {
				return true; //not link unload event - show the regular alert
			} else {
				// do somethings else - i.e open themed modal.
			}
		}
	});
    
}

###Install
Are-You-Sure is a light-weight jQuery plugin - it's a single standalone 
JavaScript file. You can download the 
[jquery.are-you-sure.js](https://raw.github.com/codedance/jquery.AreYouSure/master/jquery.are-you-sure.js)
file and include it in your page. Because it's so simple it seems a shame 
to add an extra browser round trip. It's recommended that you consider
concatenating it with other common JS lib files, and/or even cut-n-pasting 
the code (and license header) into one of your existing JS files.

If you're using, or like, *Are-you-sure* make sure you star/watch this project
so you can stay up-to-date with updates.


###Demo
This [demo page](http://www.papercut.com/products/free_software/are-you-sure/demo/are-you-sure-demo.html)
hosts a number of example forms.


###Known Issues & Limitations
 * The custom message option may not work on Firefox ([Firefox bug 588292](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=588292)).
 * The ```windows.beforeunload``` event is not supported on current Opera (Feb 2013).  This will change with their move to WebKit.


###Future
The aim is to keep *Are-you-sure* simple and light. If you think you have 
a good idea which is aligned with this objective, please voice your thoughts 
in the issues list.
